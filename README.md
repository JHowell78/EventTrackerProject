### Concert Tracker

This is an app designed to track various data points about concerts a user has attended. They can use this app to see how many times they have seen a particular artist, how many states have they been to a concert in, or even how many concerts they went to in any given year.

Routes these are as follows:

Main Route: http://52.14.71.152:8080/ConcertTracker/api/concerts/
